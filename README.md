Welcome to example of ***chain of responsibility pattern*** in real iOS Projects. I have tried to explain how to use it in blog post 👇🏻

https://ahmetkeskin.medium.com/handle-deep-linking-with-chain-of-responsibility-pattern-815902a9dc50

The main purpose of the example project is that how do we use SOLID's two prinsiples;
- Single Responsibility
- Open-Closed

and one of the design patters;
- Strategy Pattern

and bonus --> added some unit test for deeplink items ^_^
